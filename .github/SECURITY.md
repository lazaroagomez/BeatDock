# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
I only provide support and security updates for the latest version of BeatDock. Please ensure you are using the most recent release.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅ |
| older versions | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public Issue**.

Instead, choose one of the following private channels:

1. Open a confidential GitHub *Security Advisory*.
2. Email **lazaro98@duck.com**.

I aim to acknowledge reports within **48&nbsp;hours** and, if confirmed, release a fix within **7&nbsp;days**.

Thank you for helping keep BeatDock and its users safe!
